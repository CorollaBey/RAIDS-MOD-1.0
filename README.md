# - Raids mode was prepared by CorollaBey for Starblast. Currently raids are not available in this file (I'm talking about aliens who will come to destroy you in the game). Because the current raids are truly terrible. I have really good ideas in my mind, but I cannot implement these ideas because I do not know the software. I plan to work with a software developer in the future. I'll be happy to play when that happens. It will be a mode that you will enjoy very much. But right now it's just a team mode with different ships. But you will love the ship designs.
